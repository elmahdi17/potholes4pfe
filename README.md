Pothole Detection Project
This project made by MAHDI AIT AMGHAR is designed to detect potholes in videos using the YOLOv4 Tiny object detection model.
The project processes video input, detects potholes, and overlays the detection on the video. 
Additionally, it saves the coordinates of detected potholes along with an image for each detection.
