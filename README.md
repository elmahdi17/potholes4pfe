Pothole Detection Project
This project made by MAHDI AIT AMGHAR creates a Tkinter application that displays a video feed and detects potholes using a YOLOv4-tiny model. It includes buttons to start the car dashboard and toggle the detection feed, which only activates after the dashboard initialization. When potholes are detected, the application plays a beep sound, with a double beep for large, close potholes. pothole detections are highlighted with yellow rectangles
